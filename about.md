# About
___

Hey there, happy you've decided to stop by. This site serves as my personal blog for hacking writeups, projects, and other blog-esque activities. The writeups you will find here are from hacking challenges such as HackTheBox and CTFs. I enjoy looking through new environments and finding/exploiting vulnerabilities, then trying to determine what would stop my attacks. I have been doing this since 2020 when I found my passion for cybersecurity as a space.



If you wish to see the main post feed of this site, click the large **CyberCherney** up above or use this link: [Main feed](index). Below you will find a short description of my certifications in the event you are unfamiliar with them. Clicking the icon itself will bring you to Credly allowing you to verify my possession of the certificate.

# My Certifications

## CompTIA Security+

**Recommended Certification:** CompTIA Network+  
**Recommended Experience:** 2 years IT administration

The Security+ certification is a system administrator certification with a heavy focus on security. That two year recommendation is a reference to who the exam would be geared towards, and though my possession of this certification does not circumvent years of IT administration work, it does imply that I have a similar competency when it comes to security and network infrastructure design, installation, and maintenance. 

### Skills from Security+: 
\> Threat Analysis and Risk Management  
\> Secured Network Design and Architecture  
\> Incident Response and Recovery  
\> Identity and Access Management  
\> Secure Software Development  

## CompTIA Pentest+

**Recommended Certifications:** CompTIA Network+, CompTIA Security+  
**Recommended Experience:** Minimum 3-4 years of hands-on information

This certification is geared heavily towards penetration testing, ethical hacking, and vulnerability assessments. Though much of the subject material of the Pentest+ aligns with the penetration testing lifecycle, there are some important key takeaways: 

1. 1) The hacking mindset centers around taking apart something and fully understanding it to find vulnerabilities. I have an innate curiosity and am a quick learner meaning I thrive with new tech and in new environments.  
<br>
2. 2) Finding and executing exploits in many environments takes a thorough understanding of the technologies in use, meaning I have expansive knowledge of common enterprise networks and ways to either exploit or secure those environments.  
<br>
3. 3) There is a big focus on reporting and presenting findings which translates directly to my ability to reach a wide range of audiences with technical and non-technical information, along with a general ability to structure and write documentation to be easy to read and follow.  

### Skills from Pentest+:  
\> Vulnerability assessments  
\> Penetration Testing
