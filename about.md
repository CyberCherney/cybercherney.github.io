# About

Hey there, happy you've decided to stop by. This site serves as my personal blog for hacking writeups, projects, and other blog-esque activities. The writeups found here are from hacking challenges such as HackTheBox and CTFs. I enjoy looking through new environments and finding/exploiting vulnerabilities, then trying to determine what would stop my attacks. I have been doing this since 2020 when I found my passion for cybersecurity as a space.

As it stands right now I am interested and specialized in exploring Bug Bounties and webapp pentesting. There are dozens of attacks vectors in an ever changing environment of security research breakthroughs and new products, giving me more than enough topics to sink my teeth into. Posts centered around my successes or interesting quirks I've come across will pop up from time to time. When they do if you would like to see those the *blog* tag is what they would be under, or [this link works too](tags#blog). If you wish to see the main post feed of this site, click the large **CyberCherney** up above or use this link: [Main feed](index).
