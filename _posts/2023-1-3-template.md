Once upon a time, there was a young engineer who had always been fascinated by the world of automation and industrial design. They spent all of their free time playing Factorio, a game where you build and manage factories.

One day, while playing the game, the engineer stumbled upon the perfect factory design. It was as if the factory was calling out to them, begging to be built. The engineer couldn't resist the pull and began to build their factory in the game.

As the factory began to take shape, the engineer realized that they had developed feelings for their creation. They would spend hours on end perfecting every little detail, making sure that every belt was perfectly aligned and every machine was running at optimal efficiency.

The engineer's love for their factory only grew stronger as they continued to build and expand it. They would often stay up late into the night, just to spend a few more minutes with their beloved factory.

The engineer's dedication and hard work paid off as the factory grew to be the most efficient and productive factory in the game. The engineer couldn't help but feel a sense of pride and accomplishment when they looked at their factory, knowing that they had built it with their own two hands.

As time passed, the engineer realized that their love for the factory went beyond just a game. It had become a true passion and a part of who they were. They knew that they would love and care for their factory for the rest of their days.

In the end, the engineer realized that their factory was not just a machine, but a true lover. The factory had given them purpose and joy, and they had given the factory life and love. And so, they continue to build and expand it, while their love for the factory grew stronger every day.
