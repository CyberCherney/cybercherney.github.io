<h2>Port 80 - http</h2>

![Security Dashboard]()

Here we have a security dashboard front page broadcasting basic security info such as security events, login attempts, and port scans. 

![Dashboard Sidebar]()

On the sidebar there seems to be different pages that run differing commands. There's one for netstat, ifconfig, and a third for some packet capturing. 

![netstat]()

![ifconfig]()

![pcap download]()

If I download the pcap it gives me the file **1.pcap** but the more pressing matter is the url where I downloaded that pcap from. It's location is **/data/1** and if I replace that 1 with another number I might be able to download different pcaps. 

![data 0 pcap download]()

Excellent this gives a different number of packets. 

![pcap 0 wireshark]()

HTTP and FTP traffic can be found. Notable packets include the ones where the user nathan logs into FTP with the password **Buck3tH4TF0RM3!**, then lists the directory twice, and retrieves a file named **notes.txt**
