<h1>Summary</h1>

Cap is a clever name for this box as it involves looking through a pcap file for credentials to login as the user nathan. To obtain root the user must use a cap_setuid capability set for python. Overall basic but a pretty good test of some fundamentals. 

<h1>Enumeration</h1>

<h2>nmap</h2>

```bash
nmap 10.10.10.245 -sC
```

```

<h2>Port 80 - http</h2>

![Security Dashboard](/img/cap/security_dashboard.png)

Here we have a security dashboard front page broadcasting basic security info such as security events, login attempts, and port scans. 

![Dashboard Sidebar](/img/cap/Cap_dashboard_sidebar.png)

On the sidebar there seems to be different pages that run differing commands. There's one for netstat, ifconfig, and a third for some packet capturing.

<h1>User as nathan</h1>

<h2>IDOR</h2>

If I download the pcap it gives me the file **1.pcap** but the more pressing matter is the url where I downloaded that pcap from. It's location is **/data/1** and if I replace that 1 with another number I might be able to download different pcaps. 

![data 0 pcap download](/img/cap/Cap_dashboard_data_0.png)

Excellent this gives a different number of packets and a different pcap file entirely. This is called Insecure Direct Object Reference, and as the name implies it allows an attacker to guess subsequent or future entries due to them following some scheme or pattern. 

<h2>PCAP Analysis</h2>

![pcap 0 wireshark](/img/cap/Cap_pcap_0_wireshark.png)

HTTP and FTP traffic can be found. Notable packets include the ones where the user nathan logs into FTP with the password **Buck3tH4TF0RM3!**, then lists the directory twice, and fails to retrieve a file named **notes.txt**. 

Now I've made this mistake in the pass where I spend hours enumerating through a service like ftp or a wordpress login, when I should always try that new password with the user for an ssh login. 

```bash
┌─[raccoon@cyberraccoon-virtualbox]─[~/_hacking/HackTheBox/Retired/Cap]
└──╼ $ssh nathan@10.10.10.245
nathan@10.10.10.245's password: 

Last login: Thu May 27 11:21:27 2021 from 10.10.14.7
nathan@cap:~$ cat user.txt

<h1>Root</h1>

<h2>Capabilities</h2>

```bash
nathan@cap:~$ getcap -r / 2>/dev/null
/usr/bin/python3.8 = cap_setuid,cap_net_bind_service+eip
/usr/bin/ping = cap_net_raw+ep
/usr/bin/traceroute6.iputils = cap_net_raw+ep
/usr/bin/mtr-packet = cap_net_raw+ep
/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/gstreamer1.0/gstreamer-1.0/gst-ptp-helper = cap_net_bind_service,cap_net_admin+ep
```

<h2>cap_setuid</h2>

For the uninitiated, capabilities are a way to give specific administrative rights to commands, scripts etc.. that allow them to perform necessary functions without creating security issues, most of the time anyway. Take the capability **cap_net_bind_service**, which allows the service or command to bind to a port without needing root permissions or a password. 

For our purposes capabilities such as **cap_setuid** are what we look for, and with it attached to python is makes priv esc simple. We can construct a python command which imports the os module for linux command running, then set the user id to 0 (root) and run **/bin.bash** with **os.system**. 

```bash
nathan@cap:~$ python3 -c "import os; os.setuid(0); os.system('/bin/bash')"
root@cap:~# cat /root/root.txt
