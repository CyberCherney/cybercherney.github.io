post_description: "Usage is an easy box which begins with SQL injection on the password reset endpoint. After grabbing the admin username and password the admin profile page has a profile picture upload which can be abused to upload a reverse shell. Within the dash user's home directory is a hard coded password which is for the xander user. Finally xander can use a binary with sudo and through exploiting some 7zip logic arbitrary file reading can be achieved as root, giving both the root flag and the root ssh key."

## Port 80 - Blog

![default login landing page]({{ page.img }}_login_page.png)

Three basic functions here, registering, a login portal, and a second login portal with admin. Gives us a free subdomain to add to /etc/hosts, going over I see another login portal for a different service. I'll head over to that one once I know how the regular usage.htb functions. I make an account and login.

{% include img_link src="/img/usage/usage_front_page_postlogin" alt="front_page" ext="png" trunc=600 %}

Nothing to do here, it's a blog post site with no links or references to other material. I'll scan this domain for anything hidden but my guess is what we see is what we get.

```bash
dirsearch -u http://usage.htb -x 503,403

  _|. _ _  _  _  _ _|_    v0.4.3.post1
 (_||| _) (/_(_|| (_| )

Extensions: php, aspx, jsp, html, js | HTTP method: GET | Threads: 25 | Wordlist size: 11460

Output File: /home/raccoon/_hacking/HackTheBox/Misc/Usage/reports/http_usage.htb/_24-08-08_16-48-44.txt

Target: http://usage.htb/

[16:48:44] Starting: 
[16:49:51] 200 -    5KB - /registration
```

Yeah that's about what I expected. I'll check admin.usage.htb while I have dirsearch spun up. To my surprise it does leak that this is running laravel.

```bash
dirsearch -u http://admin.usage.htb -x 503,403

```

I test around with some laravel exploits but the one I could find relies on the logs file, which appears to not be present here. It's time to check each login portal and the password reset for SQLi to rule out that as the foothold.


# User as dash

## SQLi

No dice on the admin portal, nothing on the regular login for the blog, but a stray quote gives a 500 error.

![500 error from stray quote]({{ page.img }}_server_error.png)

Furthermore making the email parameter equal to `&email=raccoon%40raccoon.xyz'+and+1='1` gives a positive result, meaning this is vulnerable to some form of injection. Here I can use sqlmap and manually dig around more in the laravel vulnerabilities while I wait. The results:

Disclaimer: I did check the users table for info but it looked to be all the accounts I made for testing. I will toss this into john and I assume in this easy box rockyou has the password within.

Okay so in dumping the name column I do realize that there is a username column. The actual name is admin and not Administrator.

{% include img_link src="/img/usage/usage_admin_dashboard" alt="front_page" ext="png" trunc=300 %}

Simple dashboard with info about versions and info. I can add Users, Roles and Permissions, but none of these are what catches my eye.

![Admin profile page]({{ page.img }}_admin_profile.png)

Within this page there is something that sticks out like a sore thumb: the image upload functionality. You can't make an omelet without breaking a few eggs, time to fuzz this upload for all it's worth. 

The notable findings are it checks the ending extension locally within the webapp, it filters certain characters (/%) and replaces them with an _ within the file name. I test the extensions it allows and it is true to the requiring an image extension to the uploaded file. 

Here I search and find an advisory about smuggling PHP files through the upload and then executing them ([found here](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-g857-47pm-3r32)). There is a specific exploit script [here on github by IDUZZEL](https://github.com/IDUZZEL/CVE-2023-24249-Exploit). I won't need this though as the exploit happens when you upload a file ending in an image extension, and you intercept and change that extension, no server-side check happens within this version.

I upload my pentestmonkey.php file for a simple shell and upload it, then head to /uploads/images/pentestmonkey.php and pop a shell not as www-data but as a user.

There is a keypair present in .ssh so I'll ssh in for a full TTY.

In the home directory of dash I find series of files relating to Monit. I look around the rc file and find a hard coded password.

To interact with this webserver I need to SSH tunnel and access it from my local machine.

```bash
ssh -i id_rsa dash@usage.htb -L 2812:localhost:2812

And after a quick login with `admin:3nc0d3d_pa$$w0rd` we are in.

![monit dashboard]({{ page.img }}_monit_dashboard.png)

Nothing was here to enumerate further, but with that password it's worth checking if it is a user's password. I check with dash first to find any sudo usage, not his password. Next to try ssh with xander.

```bash
ssh xander@usage.htb

The info we have here is the whole html directory seems to be 7zipped into a backup directory. We can make a few assumptions here that we will run with until they are disproven. Firstly 7zip is the backbone of this functionality so any exploit of logic within that is our golden goose. Secondly the code calling the zipping function might be doing so with a wildcard.

[This hacktricks section](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/linux-hardening/privilege-escalation/wildcards-spare-tricks?source=post_page-----16397895490f--------------------------------#id-7z) goes over ways to exploit spare wildcards. 7z is here and thanks to the wildcard you can add two files: @file and file where the regular file is a symlink to another resource. When the 7z sees @file it will view it as a file containing a list of files it needs to compress. Upon reading the file an error will be thrown and the contents are printed to the console. 

To test all of this I will make an @user.txt and user.txt symlink since I cannot read them as xander and check the output of the binary.

```bash
xander@usage:/var/www/html$ touch @user.txt
xander@usage:/var/www/html$ ln -s /home/dash/user.txt user.txt
xander@usage:/var/www/html$ cat
