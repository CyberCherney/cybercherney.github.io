<h1>Summary</h1>

Late is an easy difficulty box with practically two parts. The first was to identify the image upload function on the http site was vulnerable to SSTI and crafting an image to serve as the payload. The second was to find an SSH login alert bash script that was run as root and writeable by everyone. 

<h1>Enumeration</h1>

This box I decided to try <code>rustscan</code> to scan for open ports and services. It's effectively a wrapper around <code>nmap</code> which allows for additional functionality and faster scanning, but in my case I use it for the latter of those reasons. 

```
rustscan 10.10.11.156 | tee results.scan
```

```

Taking a look around we can quickly find in the FAQ a link to the online photo editor. That specific link directs to <code>images.late.htb</code>
