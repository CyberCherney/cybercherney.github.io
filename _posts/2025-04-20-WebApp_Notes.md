post_description: "This is a compilation of web application hacking notes I have put together after years of labs, challenges, and read writeups. Each note comes with a methodology on how to explore that functionality or search for and exploit that vulnerability. These notes will be updated as I update my personal notes and more sections will appear as I get around to parsing the scrambled notes I have into coherent methodologies and examples."

## Summary

Welcome to an endeavor I have spent some effort to create: my webapp notes from online challenges, writeups, and labs (aka Portswigger Academy). These serve as a baseline for what to try when given a certain functionality you are exploring or a given vulnerability you are searching for. As I add more to my personal notes and finish out more functionality and vulnerability pages they shall appear here. 

As always if you intend to use these for Bug Bounty Hunting: hack safely, I am not responsible for anything that happens when following these methodologies. These notes assume you are manually hacking parts of an application, if you are unfamiliar with that head over to Portswigger to get some practical hands-on webapp hacking for free.
