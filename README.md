[My personal site](https://cybercherney.github.io) was made off of the [Architect theme](https://github.com/pages-themes/architect). The table of contents sidebar was made with [this guide](https://afeld.github.io/bootstrap-toc/).

This site is a WiP as I port over old HTB writeups and write the new non-active box writeups. Probably planning to add links and an about me/contact me. Tags page is up in the air: looking for a simple jekyll plugin to create and manage the pages.
