[My personal site](https://cybercherney.github.io) was made off of the [Architect theme](https://github.com/pages-themes/architect). The table of contents sidebar was made with [this guide](https://afeld.github.io/bootstrap-toc/). 

The image truncating is from ![0xdf's gitlab for their site](https://gitlab.com/0xdf/blog-nuggests). If you want to use it yourself copy the file called img_link in  _includes and then use 

```python
{% include img_link src="/img/backdoor/front_page" alt="front_page" ext="png" trunc=600 %}
```

This site is a WiP as I port over old HTB writeups and write the new non-active box writeups. Probably planning to add links and an about me/contact me. There is an odd bug where some script blocks will not scroll, might fix that later.
