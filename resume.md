# About
___

Hey there, happy you've decided to stop by. This site serves as my personal blog for hacking writeups, projects, and other blog-esque activities. Typically I participate machine hacking challenges and CTFs then post the steps I used to complete the respective challenge. I enjoy looking through new environments and finding/exploiting vulnerabilities, then trying to determine what would stop my attacks. I have been doing this for around 4 years, though much of the initial 2 years was learning fundamental technologies at play and the recent 2 years has been developing off of those skills and honing my abilities. I'm driven by passion and knowledgeable within the field, and I would be ecstatic to be given the opportunity to demonstrate my abilities.

Below you will find a short description of my certifications in the event you are unfamiliar with them. Clicking the icon itself will bring you to credly allowing you to verify my possession of the certificate.

### Recommended Experience: Comptia Network+ and two years IT administration

The Security+ certification is a system administrator certification with a heavy focus on security. That two year recommendation is a reference to who the exam would be geared towards, and though my possession of this certification does not circumvent years of IT administration work, it does imply that I have a similar competency when it comes to security and network infrastructure design, installation, and maintenance. 

**Skills that this certification implies:** understanding network and security infrastructure within enterprise environments, pentesting and vulnerability scanning concepts, identity and access services + access controls, understanding risk management and best practices, wireless security, and PKI.

### Recommended Experience: Comptia Network+, Comptia Security+ and Minimum 3-4 years of hands-on information security or related.

This certification is geared heavily towards penetration testing, ethical hacking, and vulnerability assessments. Though much of these skills align with the penetration testing lifecycle, there are some important key takeaways. Firstly the report writing aspect of the certification translates directly to documentation. Secondly finding and executing exploits in many environments takes a thorough understanding of the technologies in use. This means I have expansive knowledge of common enterprise networks and ways to either exploit or secure those environments.  

**Skills that his certification implies:** planning and scoping assessments/penetration tests, vulnerability scanning, common exploits and attack vectors, understanding legal and compliance requirements, results analysis, and report writing/communication.
